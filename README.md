# Neural-Networks
 Challenge 19


### This module we to learn about neural netowrks. We are going to train a model that will help us know whether we should make an investment or not. 
The important part here is to first look at the data (csv) and see how the information is given. The first question is, what information is important? What are the targets for the model and what are the features for the model?

We first drop some columns that we believe aren't relevant. 


We then are going to separate the rare categorical values that we have. As well as for features and target analysis. 


### We now need to compile, Train, and Evaluate the model. They key here is to have different models in order to see which one is the most accurate one. With different models we will be able to keep the most accurate one. 
Neural networks works with layers that have activation functions. 

At the end it will be possible to see the model and its accuracy.

### Saving Models 
The good thing about the models is that now that they are trained, it is possible to save them for later use. This is really handy as we are able to provode/send the model to someone else. That person does not need to create his own model anynore.

### Ending 
At the end, task 3, they are asking us to train a model and get above 75% accuracy. The goal is to test diffent models, with more neurons or more layers and look at the output.
